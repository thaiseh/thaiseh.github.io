      <p> In research, my main areas of interest are child psychology, gender psychology and their application in real-world interventions. <br>
	  I was a research assistant for these papers where I helped to gather data, code it and analyze it.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> - SEXY AND STRONG? EXAMINING HOW SELF SEXUALIZATION LEADS TO EMPOWERMENT (DR. SARAH MURNEN) | KENYON COLLEGE</li>
	  <li> - WHAT ARE THEY WATCHING? MEDIA CONSUMPTION OF CHILDREN AGED 9-11 (STUDENT HONORS THESIS) | KENYON COLLEGE </li>
	</ul> <br>
      <p> In addtion to these papers, I also had the opportunity to lead my own research project as a Summer Science Scholar at Kenyon College. I devised my own 
	    method of data-gathering to analyze how insults related to mental health stigma were used in Brazilian soap operas and how that related to race, class and
	    gender. <br> <br>
	    Lastly, I was also able to serve as a Graduate Research Assistant in the BRIGHT PROJECT at Boston University. This program was an intervention designed to
	    help mothers who had been addicted to various substances reconnected with their children and be better parents. This position was especially useful to me
	    because it allowed me to see the ways in which research can help actual people in the real world, as well as helping me learn how the standards of research
	    based practice are set and how important they are.</p>
