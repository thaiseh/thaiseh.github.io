    			<p> Hello everyone! My name is Thaís and this is the corner of my website dedicated to my tarot hobby. 
            I started reading tarot a little over 6 months ago and I really love it! Mostly because you can get so many different things out of it: 
            messages from the universe, a pause to ponder deeply on your life’s issues or, if nothing else, a fun lark. I learned tarot from a lot of 
            different online resources, but mostly from biddytarot.com. Really, the main thing is just to do whatever feels right.</p>
