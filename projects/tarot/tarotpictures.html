			<h3>Here's a list and description of my favorite spreads and why I like them</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Spread for Decision Making</li>
				<ol>
					<li>What happens if you choose option 1?</li>
					<li>What happens if you choose option 2?</li>
					<li>Advice</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I love this spread for when I have to decide whether or not I "should" do something. I have found that, for my cards at least, the tarot doesn't love "should" questions. For the universe, there is no "should" or "must" or "have to", there is only consequences for your actions.
					The tarot can't tell you what you SHOULD do, you can do whatever you want. It can tell you what will happen if you do (which I usually make my 1st card or option 1) and what will happen if you don't (the second card/option 2) and you can make a decision based on those consequences and any advice the tarot has.
				</p>
				<li>The Celtic Cross</li>
				<ol>
					<li>What covers you? What is the current situation of the problem?</li>
					<li>What crosses you? What are the obstacles?</li>
					<li>What crowns you? What is the situation about on a concious level?</li>
					<li>What is beneath you? What is the situation about on a unconcious level?</li>
					<li>What is before you? What is the recent past of the situation?</li>
					<li>What is after you? What is the near future of the situation?</li>
					<li>What is within you? What is your attitute towards the situation?</li>
					<li>What is around you? How do people/external forces view or affect the situation?</li>
					<li>What are your hopes and fears regarding this situation?</li>
					<li>What will be the outcome of the situation?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>This one is a classic. Probably the one spread that is in most decks and most people who've dabbled with tarot have at least heard of it. While the general idea and card layout remains the same in every version, there's a lot of variation out for each card position and it's worth doing a little digging to find the Celtic Cross that is YOUR Celtic Cross. 
					As you try out different ones, you will naturally pick up and stick to the meanings that resonate most with you. Some beginner tarot readers find the number of cards a little daunting, but I actually love having a lot of cards to draw conclusions and interpretations from.
			</p>
				<li>Past, Present, Future</li>
				<ol>
					<li>The past of the situation/querent</li>
					<li>The present of the situation/querent</li>
					<li>The future of the situation/querent</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I don't actually do this one for myself very often, but a lot of people who just want a quick, not-that-deep reading choose this one. It's pretty straightfoward.</p>
				<li>Mind, Body, Spirit</li>
				<ol><li>(optional) What is a message about your heart that the universe wants you to hear?</li>
				<li>What is a message about your mind that the universe wants you to hear?</li>
				<li>What is a message about your body that the universe wants you to hear?</li>
				<li>What is a message about your spirit that the universe wants you to hear?</li></ol>
				<p>I love this reading for times when you feel slightly off, but don't know why, or you want a little guidance, but you're not sure about what. This is a great reading to do daily to check in with yourself and how you're doing.</p>
