			<p> hello everyone! My name is thaís and this is a website dedicated to my tarot hobby. I started reading tarot a little over 6 months ago and I really love it! Mostly because you can get so many different things out of it: messages from the universe, a pause to ponder deeply on your life’s issues or, if nothing else, a fun lark. I learned tarot from a lot of different online resources, but mostly from biddytarot.com. Really, the main thing is just to do whatever feels right. A little more about me: I’m 24, I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, went to college in a rural town in Ohio, did a brief (miserable) stint in Boston, and now I’m here! (los angeles!) There’s a lot I want for me and my life, so much that sometimes it feels too big for me and for this world and tarot helps me believe that someday I’ll achieve those things and change the world along the way. But it also helps me find meaning in the things I do now, even if it isn’t the perfect life in a socialist utopia I long for. I hope you enjoy your visit to my website!</p>
